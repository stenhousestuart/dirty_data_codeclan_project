candy_analysis <- read_csv(here("data/clean_data/candy_clean.csv"))

```

## Analysis

### Q1.
What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. 
Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values

```{r}

candy_analysis %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("JOY", "DESPAIR", "MEH")) %>% 
  summarise(total_ratings = n())

```

### Q2.
What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?

```{r}

candy_analysis %>%
  filter(going_out == "Yes") %>%
  distinct(response_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = round(mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), 0))

```


### Q3.
What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?

```{r}

candy_analysis %>%
  filter(going_out == "No") %>%
  distinct(response_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = round(mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), 0))

```

### Q4.
For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these 
ratings?

```{r}

candy_analysis %>% 
  filter(response == "JOY") %>% 
  count(candy_type, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  head(1)

```

```{r}

candy_analysis %>% 
  filter(response == "MEH") %>% 
  count(candy_type, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  head(1)

```

```{r}

candy_analysis %>% 
  filter(response == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  count(candy_type, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  head(1)

```


### Q5.
How many people rated Starburst as despair?

```{r}

candy_analysis %>% 
  filter(candy_type == "starburst" & response == "DESPAIR") %>%
